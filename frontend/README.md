# SkyInspect Frontend

## Overview

This is the React frontend for the SkyInspect project. It interacts with the backend API to provide a user interface for authentication, record management, and other features.

## Importance of Project Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is essential because:

- **Ease of Use:** New developers can quickly set up and understand the project.
- **Consistency:** Coding and design guidelines are clearly communicated.
- **Maintainability:** Future you (and others) can easily update and fix the app.
- **Collaboration:** Team members can work together effectively with clear instructions.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Ensure the backend is running and update the API base URL in your code if needed (default: `http://localhost:5001`).

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Project Structure

- `src/components/` — React components (Navbar, Login, Signup, AddRecord, etc.)
- `src/App.js` — Main app logic and routing.
- `public/` — Static assets.

### Available Scripts

- `npm start` — Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm run build` — Builds the app for production.

## API Integration

- The frontend communicates with the backend via documented REST API endpoints.
- Update API URLs in components as needed if your backend address changes.

## Contributing

- Document new components and features in this README.
- Use clear commit messages.
- Keep UI logic and API integration code organized and commented.

## Documentation Best Practices

- **Keep it updated**: Always update the documentation when changes are made.
- **Be concise but complete**: Include code samples and screenshots if possible.
- **Use Markdown**: It’s readable on GitHub and supports formatting and links.
